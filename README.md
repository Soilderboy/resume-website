This is a resume website I have running on my github pages that I plan on adding to with future projects. 

please have mercy, it's something not yet really developed :(

also like there's the rotating belt thing at the bottom (that's why I added the testimonials since I wanted to make use of the rotating belt feature I saw online)

anyways ig everything there is true and the testimonials is just like a joke thing tho I've actually heard the people on there say it before so I just put it there 
(it sounds presumptuous but I'm aware of how it sounds, i just havent tinkered with it since its creation)

also the send link/email thing doesnt work, I haven't directed it to anything. not that I really want to have emails or notifications sent to me anyways.
if you want to contact me for now, instagram or email is probably the best way. It's on my linktree
